* <2025-10-25 Sat> Assistant (Codex CLI)
- Initialized automation logging per maintainer request; created =docs/automation/=. 
- Confirmed Poetry workflow is operational (`poetry install --with dev`, `poetry run pytest`).
- Ready to record future assistant sessions in this file; add new subsections per task.
- Added release/publish automation in =Makefile= and wired `pyproject.toml` metadata for PyPI. Remember to run `make README.md` before `poetry` commands that inspect the readme.
- Resolved outstanding lint issues in `src/datamat` and the test suite; `make check` now passes cleanly.
- Added `tests/test_label_preservation.py` to lock in expectations about kron/diag labels and capture the outstanding matmul naming bug (xfail).
- Implemented fix so `DataMat @ DataMat` returning a single column now yields a `DataVec` with preserved column label; see branch =fix/matmul-labels=.
- Added auto-generated names (`vec`, `vec_1`, â€¦) for unnamed DataVecs and ensured matmul with a named vector preserves that name.
- Added `DataMat.triu`/`tril` helpers plus tests ensuring triangular masks keep MultiIndex metadata.
